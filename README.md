# ARTreasureHunt
This respository consists of my frst AR application that is still being developed titled **_AR Treasure Hunt_**. Using the Unity ARKit Plugin for iOS, it will be a simple game where the user must hunt for objects shaped to be diamonds scattered in the scene, or the room they are crrently standing in, to successfully claim the treasure and win the experience.
