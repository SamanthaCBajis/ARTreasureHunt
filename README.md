## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The software you will need to download in order to build and run the game on a mobile device:
<br />
<br /> • The cross-platform engine [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases?version=5.6&page=2 "Unity 3D download") Version 5.6.2p1.
<br />
- Only iOS builds! Will need an iOS device, along with the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/ "Xcode 9.3 Beta").
- NOTE! You will need to have an [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!&page=create "Developer Account") in order to download Xcode and build for iOS.
- NOTE! Make sure to have the latest software version; 11 and up.

### Installing
To build and run a copy of this application to your mobile device:
<br />
<br /> • On the **AR Treasure Hunt** repository, go to the green "Clone or download" button and click "Download Zip".
<br />
<br /> • Once the zip file has loaded onto your desktop, double click the zip file to open. Navigate to the folder Assets > AR Treasure Hunt.unity and double click the scene to open it in Unity 3D.
<br />
<br /> -NOTE! The scene may not be located at the top of the folder. If not, you will have to scroll through the folder to find it. It will be titled exactly AR Treasure Hunt.unity with the Unity logo-
<br />
<br /> After opening the scene in Unity build to iOS platform.
<br />
- For iOS builds:
   - Go to File > Build Settings and switch the platform to iOS (this can take a while) then click the Player Settings button below that and with this open you can change the name of the application and bundle identifier, if you would like to change them, before pressing Build and Run to then be prompted to name the build and save it. (I usually save the build to my desktop so I can delete it later) 
     - The build will open in Xcode. Make sure to check your Apple ID is correct, the bundle identifier and the name of the application is what you would like it to be then press the play button in the upper left corner and the application will build and run directly to your iOS device.

### Deployment
When building the application to your phone a few important things to note:
<br />
<br /> • In Player Settings, you are able to not only change the name of the application and bundle identifier to whatever you would like you can also add a photo to be the icon for the application on your phone. It will be one of the first things you can do in Player Settings. Right under renaming the application!
<br /> • Unitys ARKit Plugin used in the game tracks your head movement. Meaning, wherever the phone is facing, the application will open and start your game from that position. If you would like to be facing a certain direction to play the game right after building to your phone I would suggest facing your device in that direction so you can start the experience in the most comfortable position for you.


## How to play
The instructions to play the application **_AR Treasure Hunt_**:

<br />
